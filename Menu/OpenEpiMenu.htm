This is the frameset for the main menu of OpenEpi.  To change the menu items, edit the file called CODE.HTML.

OpenEpi is an Open Source project, supported in part by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation 
to Emory University to enhance the statistical capabilities of Epi Info, a public domain software package.

The Open Source movement is based on providing free access to source code so that it can be understood, 
criticized, and improved by a wide audience. We would prefer to develop our
own license along the lines of:

“OpenEpi source code, documentation, and concepts are available to all to use as they wish.  
Please help improve the code by sending suggestions or new code back to the authors. We suggest citation 
to acknowledge contributing authors’ works as with any scientific publication.

The user assumes responsibility for determining appropriate use of the software, for consequences of its use, 
and for checking results against other reliable sources. No warrantee of any kind is given. ”

Since the wording above does not constitute an approved Open Source license, we have also chosen to apply the 
“MIT License” found on the www.opensource.org site."

The menu uses a Javascript control called dTree, copyrighted by Geir Landro whose email address can be obtained by 
clicking his name in the tree frame.  His license allows free use and distribution.

<!-- From the IncludeFiles.js section, ancillary modules are included that contain necessary code.  Generally you will not
have to alter code in these modules, but they are all available as part of the source, and are listed in IncludeFiles.js. -->
